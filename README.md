# Data Download
Download and preprocess the data.
```bash
mkdir data && cd data
# Download GloVe pre-trained word embedding
wget https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
sudo apt install unzip
unzip glove.840B.300d.zip -d glove
rm glove.840B.300d.zip

# Download MIND dataset
# By downloading the dataset, you agree to the [Microsoft Research License Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206977). For more detail about the dataset, see https://msnews.github.io/.
# Uncomment the following lines to use the MIND Small dataset (Note MIND Small doesn't have a test set, In our paper we use the validation data from the original dataset as test data in this experiment.
# In addition, the training data in the original dataset are divided into the training data (first 5 days) and the validation data (last 1 day) for this experiment. So you need to do the splitting of the data set after downloading:)
